## Instructions

### Iteration 1 - Create the App

Let's start with the basics: as you can see `public` folder is already there and it has some images in it. Let's edit `App.jsx` and other files in order to recreate what we see on the screenshot.

Please, recreate at least one of the elements on the page as an independent component, and add it to the `/src/components` folder.

Happy coding! :heart:
